h1. *Convert your PS1 games to VCD format*



______________________________________________________________________________________________________________


POPS doesnâ€™t support PS1 games images as .iso. It uses virtual CD-ROM format (VCD files). You need to create a 1:1 image of your PS1 game, first in BIN+CUE format using your favorite dump software, then to convert it to VCD. 

Your BIN image must be a raw MODE2/2352 dump and the CUE a standard ASCII cuesheet. Open the CUE file in a text editor and check the first lines. If you can see "MODE2/2352", it's ok. 
 
* *How to convert to VCD format :*

To convert your PS1 games from BIN+CUE to VCD format, you need to use the last version of "CUE2POPS":https://bitbucket.org/ShaolinAssassin/popstarter-documentation-stuff/wiki/apps-last-version.

# Put your BIN+CUE image of your PS1 game in CUE2POPS folder ;
# Drag and drop your CUE file on CUE2POPS.EXE file ;
# A VCD image of your game is created in CUE2POPS folder. 

*Notes :* 

* You can convert several games at once by running the BULK_CUE2POPS.BAT. BULK_CUE2POPS.BAT must be placed in CUE2POPS folder, along with your PS1 game images, as BIN+CUE ;
* If your PS1 game images has several .bin file, you can merge them into a single BIN+CUE file using "CDmage Version 1.02.1 Beta 5":http://aybabtu.chez.com/cdmage1-02-1b5.zip ;
* For multi-disc games, please read this section about how to use the "swap disc feature":https://bitbucket.org/ShaolinAssassin/popstarter-documentation-stuff/wiki/multi-disc.
