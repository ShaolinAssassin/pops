h1. *POPStarter for internal HDD*


______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
_[Up-to-date with WIP 06, OBT 13 (2015/12/07)]_

h2. _POPS decrypted files :_

To use POPStarter with an internal HDD, you have to find and download the POPS decrypted files. These files are named "POPS.ELF" and "IOPRP252.IMG"... You are on your own to find them (google is your friend ;) )


| *File name* | *MD5* | *Description* | *Location* |
| POPS.ELF | 355a892a8ce4e4a105469d4ef6f39a42 | main SLBB-00001 ELF, decrypted | __common/POPS/ |
| IOPRP252.IMG | 1db9c6020a2cd445a7bb176a1a3dd418 | can be found in some retail game discs and $CEI SDKs too | __common/POPS/ |

h2. _Other Software Requirements :_

* A software that allows you to convert your disc images to the POPS virtual CDROM format (such as ToolBox )
* A software that allows you to manage/create partitions in your PS2 HDD (such as AKuHAK's uLaunchELF build or uLE_kHn build)
* A software that allows you to copy the decrypted POPS files to the __common partition of your PS2 HDD (such as AKuHAK's uLaunchELF build or uLE_kHn build)
* A software that allows you to transfer the converted disc images to your PS2 HDD (such as PFSshell, or uLaunchELF and RadHostClient...)
* A PS2 software that allows you to execute the POPStarter ELFs (such as uLaunchELF, or Free Harddisk Drive Boot...) or a GUI to execute POPSTARTER.ELF by selecting the VCDs (such as uLE_kHn_20150602)

h2. _Hardware Requirements :_

* A PS2 console which is able to run PS2 unsigned code
* A network adapter with/or a HDD interface
* A PS2-formatted HDD that fits your network adapter/HDD interface

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

h2. _A) Installing the Emulator :_

# Find and download the decrypted emulator files;
# Create a directory named "POPS" in the "__common" partition of your PS2 HDD;
# Paste POPS.ELF and IOPRP252.IMG into the "POPS" directory you've just created.

h2. _B) Installing your PS1 Games :_ 

# Convert your BIN/CUE disc images to .VCD files using the latest stable version of Toolbox;
# Create a partition named "__.POPS" in your PS2 HDD, large enough so you can put all your VCDs inside.

h2. _C) Installing POPStarter :_ 

# Rename the POPStarter ELF as the name of your VCDs, replace the .VCD extension with a .elf extension;[example : for running a VCD named "Gran Turismo.VCD", the POPStarter ELF must be renamed as "Gran Turismo.elf"]
# Copy or leave the ELFs where you want to run them from.

h2. _Examples of Setups :_ 

 

pre. 
=== INTERNAL HDD, NEW LAUNCH TYPE ===
__common/POPS/IOPRP252.IMG
__common/POPS/POPS.ELF
__.POPS/Crash Bandicoot.VCD
__sysconf/FMCB/Crash Bandicoot.elf




pre. 
=== INTERNAL HDD, OLD LAUNCH TYPE (HIDDEN PARTITION) ===
__common/POPS/IOPRP252.IMG
__common/POPS/POPS.ELF
__.Crash_Bandicoot/IMAGE0.VCD
__sysconf/FMCB/__.Crash Bandicoot.elf




pre. 
=== INTERNAL HDD, OLD LAUNCH TYPE (HDDOSD COMPATIBLE) ===

__common/POPS/POPS.ELF
PP.Crash_Bandicoot/EXECUTE.KELF
PP.Crash_Bandicoot/IMAGE0.VCD

h2. _POPSTARTER.KELF :_ 

POPStarter bundle comes with a POPSTARTER.KELF (Krypo-ELF = ELF embedded into a container). It can be used if you have the Browser 2.00 aka HDDOSD installed on your HDD. Otherwise, it's useless. Use AkuHak's hdl_dumx to install it.

*Notes if you use the POPStarter.KELF :* 
* Partition name prefix is of course PP. (PPdot)
* 1 partition = 1 game


______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

h2. _Additional notes :_


* The internal HDD has to be PS2 formatted. If you need to format it, I'd recommend you use the latest WIP version of AKuHAK's uLaunchELF HDD edition.

* HDD supports 3 launch types. Each type uses is own prefix for the POPSTARTER.ELF and his own way to name the VCD file : 

*1. Old launch type (HDDOSD compatible) :* 

| *Prefix for POPStarter.ELF* | PP. (PP(dot))  -    (if used) |
| *Prefix for partition name* | PP. (PP(dot)) |
| *Game name* | IMAGE0.VCD (all uppercase) |
| *Description* | This is a launch type that was used in POPStarter 12 and older versions. It allows you to install one VCD per partition. |
| *Example* | With the POPStarter ELF renamed as "PP.Some Game.elf", POPStarter will launch IMAGE0.VCD which is in the partition named "PP.Some Game". |
| *Notes* | The partition is shown in the HDDOSD / PSBBN / PSX XMB. |


_Prefix for POPStarter.ELF :_ PP. (PP(dot))  -    (if used)
_Prefix for partition name :_ PP. (PP(dot))
_Game name :_ IMAGE0.VCD (all uppercase)
_Description :_ This is a launch type that was used in POPStarter 12 and older versions. It allows you to install one VCD per partition. The VCD has to be named "IMAGE0.VCD" (all uppercase).
_Example :_ With the POPStarter ELF renamed as "PP.Some Game.elf", POPStarter will launch IMAGE0.VCD which is in the partition named "PP.Some Game".
_Notes :_ 
The partition is shown in the HDDOSD / PSBBN / PSX XMB.
The partition names are case sensitive, and have to match the POPStarter ELF names.
Whitespaces are not allowed in the partition names.
The file extension .VCD has to be uppercase.

---- Alternate Old launch type (HDDOSD compatible)
- Prefix for POPStarter.ELF : __. (__(dot))  -    (if used)
- Prefix for partition name : __. (__(dot))
- Game name : IMAGE0.VCD (all uppercase)
- Description : This is a launch type that was used in POPStarter 12 and older versions. It allows you to install one VCD per partition. 
- Example : With the POPStarter ELF renamed as "PP.Some Game.elf", POPStarter will launch IMAGE0.VCD which is in the partition named "PP.Some Game".
- Note : The partition is NOT shown in the HDDOSD / PSBBN / PSX XMB.
The partition names are case sensitive, and have to match the POPStarter ELF names.
Whitespaces are not allowed in the partition names.
The file extension .VCD has to be uppercase.

---- New launch type (non HDDOSD compatible)
- Prefix for POPStarter.ELF : none
- Prefix for partition name : __.POPS
- Game name : Name of the Game.VCD (unlike the above launch types, the names given to the POPStarter ELFs are the names of VCDs, not the name of the partitions, since static partition names are used with this launch type)
- Description : This launch type was introduced in POPStarter 13 WIP 01. It allows you to put multiple VCDs in a single partition.
- Example : With the POPStarter ELF renamed as "Some Game.elf", POPStarter will launch "Some Game.VCD" which is in the partition named "__.POPS" or "__.POPS0" or "__.POPS1"... up to "__.POPS9".
- Notes : 
The file extension .VCD has to be uppercase.
