h1. *POPStarter for internal HDD*


______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
_[Up-to-date with WIP 06, OBT 13 (2015/12/07)]_

h2. _POPS decrypted files :_

To use POPStarter with an internal HDD, you have to find and download the POPS decrypted files. These files are named "POPS.ELF" and "IOPRP252.IMG"... You are on your own to find them (google is your friend ;) )


| *File name* | *MD5* | *Description* | *Location* |
| POPS.ELF | 355a892a8ce4e4a105469d4ef6f39a42 | main SLBB-00001 ELF, decrypted | __common/POPS/ |
| IOPRP252.IMG | 1db9c6020a2cd445a7bb176a1a3dd418 | can be found in some retail game discs and $CEI SDKs too | __common/POPS/ |

h2. _Other Software Requirements :_

* A software that allows you to convert your disc images to the POPS virtual CDROM format (such as ToolBox )
* A software that allows you to manage/create partitions in your PS2 HDD (such as AKuHAK's uLaunchELF build or uLE_kHn build)
* A software that allows you to copy the decrypted POPS files to the __common partition of your PS2 HDD (such as AKuHAK's uLaunchELF build or uLE_kHn build)
* A software that allows you to transfer the converted disc images to your PS2 HDD (such as PFSshell, or uLaunchELF and RadHostClient...)
* A PS2 software that allows you to execute the POPStarter ELFs (such as uLaunchELF, or Free Harddisk Drive Boot...) or a GUI to execute POPSTARTER.ELF by selecting the VCDs (such as uLE_kHn_20150602)

h2. _Hardware Requirements :_

* A PS2 console which is able to run PS2 unsigned code
* A network adapter with/or a HDD interface
* A PS2-formatted HDD that fits your network adapter/HDD interface

h2. _A) Installing the Emulator :_

# Find and download the decrypted emulator files;
# Create a directory named "POPS" in the "__common" partition of your PS2 HDD;
# Paste POPS.ELF and IOPRP252.IMG into the "POPS" directory you've just created.

h2. _B) Installing your PS1 Games :_ 

# Convert your BIN/CUE disc images to .VCD files using the latest stable version of CUE2POPS;
# Create a partition named "__.POPS" in your PS2 HDD, large enough so you can put all your VCDs inside.

h2. _C) Installing POPStarter :_ 

# Rename the POPStarter ELF as the name of your VCDs, replace the .VCD extension with a .elf extension;[example : for running a VCD named "Gran Turismo.VCD", the POPStarter ELF must be renamed as "Gran Turismo.elf"]
# Copy or leave the ELFs where you want to run them from.

h2. _Examples of Setups :_ 

 

pre. 
=== INTERNAL HDD, NEW LAUNCH TYPE ===
__common/POPS/IOPRP252.IMG
__common/POPS/POPS.ELF
__.POPS/Crash Bandicoot.VCD
__sysconf/FMCB/Crash Bandicoot.elf




pre. 
=== INTERNAL HDD, OLD LAUNCH TYPE (HIDDEN PARTITION) ===
__common/POPS/IOPRP252.IMG
__common/POPS/POPS.ELF
__.Crash_Bandicoot/IMAGE0.VCD
__sysconf/FMCB/__.Crash Bandicoot.elf




pre. 
=== INTERNAL HDD, OLD LAUNCH TYPE (HDDOSD COMPATIBLE) ===
__common/POPS/IOPRP252.IMG
__common/POPS/POPS.ELF
PP.Crash_Bandicoot/EXECUTE.KELF
PP.Crash_Bandicoot/IMAGE0.VCD

h2. _POPSTARTER.KELF :_ 

POPStarter bundle comes with a POPStrater.kelf (Krypo-elf,ELF embedded into a container). It can be used of you have the Browser 2.00 aka HDDOSD installed on your HDD. Otherwise, it's useless. Use AkuHak's hdl_dumx to install it.

*Notes if you use the POPStarter.KELF :* 
* Partition name prefix is of course PP. (PPdot)
* A partition per game


______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

h2. _Additional notes :_

* The internal HDD has to be PS2 formatted. If you need to format it, I'd recommend you use the latest WIP version of AKuHAK's uLaunchELF HDD edition (find the link in 0-INTRODUCTION.TXT)
* The file name "IMAGE0.VCD" has to be uppercase (old launch type)
* The file extension .VCD has to be uppercase (old launch type)
* The partition names are case sensitive, and have to match the POPStarter ELF names (old launch type)
* Whitespaces are not allowed in the partition names (old launch type)
