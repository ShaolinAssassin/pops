h2. _Few words :_

uLE_kHn is a modified version of AKuHAK's uLE 4.42e HDD edition ("WIP7":http://psx-scene.com/forums/f113/unofficial-launchelf-v4-42-a-37242/#post261143).

It has 2 main features : 
* Same as WIP7, it can create HDD partitions with no "+" symbol at start - to create the __.POPS/ partition.
* It can launch your VCDs directly so you don't have to rename your POPStarter.ELF files. Just place a copy of POPStarter.ELF in your POPS directory and you're done. 

Ex.

pre. 
=== USB DEVICE, NEW LAUNCH TYPE ===
mass:/POPS/POPS_IOP.PAK
mass:/POPS/Crash Bandicoot.VCD
mass:/POPS/POPSTARTER.ELF

*Note :* 
* SMB not supported ATM.
