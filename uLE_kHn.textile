_[Up-to-date with WIP 06, OBT 13 (2015/12/07)]_


h2. *Few words :*

uLE_kHn is a modified version of AkuHaK's uLE 4.42e HDD edition ("WIP7":http://psx-scene.com/forums/f113/unofficial-launchelf-v4-42-a-37242/#post261143)

It has 2 main features : 

* Same as WIP7, it can create HDD partitions with no "+" symbol at start - to create the __.POPS/ partition.

* It can launch your VCDs directly. Do not rename & copy POPStarter.ELF, just keep one version in your POPS directory. 

Ex.

pre. 
=== USB DEVICE, NEW LAUNCH TYPE ===
POPS/POPS_IOP.PAK
POPS/Crash Bandicoot.VCD
POPSTARTER.ELF

*Note :* 
* SMB not supported ATM.
