h1. *Special Cheats - Automated Codes*


______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Some useful commands have been automated. Here are them :


| *Cheat Code* | *Description* | *Notes* |
| $SAFEMODE | Disables the cheat engine and only activate it after POPS has left the PS OSD. | Should be always ON. Some game codes do patch the memory area where the PS OSD is loaded, causing crashes and other garbage... |
| $COMPATIBILITY_0x## | Activates a "compatibility mode":https://bitbucket.org/ShaolinAssassin/popstarter-documentation-stuff/wiki/compatibility. | ## is a hexadecimal value. You can write as many $COMPATIBILITY_0x## as you want. |
| $CODECACHE_ADDON_0 | For games that lag badly or stall randomly. | If compatibility mode and mode 0x04 doesn't fix that doesn't fix your issue. Do not use it by default on all your games, because most games will stop working with it. |
| $SUBCDSTATUS | A variant of $COMPATIBILITY_0x05. |  |
| $FAKELC | Loads a null LibCrypt magic word into the cop0 register. | May be needed by some discs that have a messed up LC protection. |
| $SMOOTH | Enables the "smooth texture":https://bitbucket.org/ShaolinAssassin/popstarter-documentation-stuff/wiki/smooth mapping at startup. | Just for the records : value is $S0003390 00000001. |
| $NOPAL | Disables POPStarters' PAL patcher. | Can be done using a "PATCH_#.BIN":https://bitbucket.org/ShaolinAssassin/popstarter-documentation-stuff/downloads/NOPAL_PATCH.7z file.  |
| $FORCEPAL | Forces the activation of the PAL patcher (POPS will run it PAL) and patches the BIOS region code to Euro (shows the boot screen in PAL).  | Useful for PAL VCDs that don't have a valid license text in their bootsector. Can be done using a "PATCH_#.BIN file":https://bitbucket.org/ShaolinAssassin/popstarter-documentation-stuff/downloads/FORCEPAL_PATCH.7z. |
| $480p | Forces 480p. | Not compatible with $XPOS, $YPOS, $DWSTRETCH, $DWCROP & NOT reliable ATM. See notes "here":https://assemblergames.com/threads/ps2-pops-stuff.45347/page-93#post-908556  |
| $"WIDESCREEN":https://bitbucket.org/ShaolinAssassin/popstarter-documentation-stuff/wiki/widescreen | Enables POPS GTE widescreen hack and forces 16:9. | Does not deal with stuff like HUDs, texts/fonts, menus, 2D backgrounds... This hack is not finished (no render fix...). |
| $ULTRA_WIDESCREEN | Same as $WIDESCREEN, but wider FOV. | Does not match any aspect ratio standard. Does not deal with stuff like HUDs, texts/fonts, menus, 2D backgrounds... |
| $EYEFINITY | Same as $WIDESCREEN, with 3x16:9 aspect ratio. | Does not deal with stuff like HUDs, texts/fonts, menus, 2D backgrounds... |
| $XPOS_#### | Centers the screen horizontally. | # is a number (decimal, negative values not supported). Works only in PAL and NTSC modes. Default value : 640. Value lower than 640 will move the screen on the left, value higher than 640 will move it to the right. Not compatible with $480p. |
| $YPOS_## | Centers the screen vertically. | # is a number (decimal, negative values not supported). Works only in PAL and NTSC modes. Not working in OBT15, fixed in OBT16. No default value, depends on the game, you have to experiment. The higher the value is, the more the screen moves down. Not compatible with $480p. |
| $"DWSTRETCH_####":https://assemblergames.com/threads/ps2-pops-stuff-popstarter.45347/page-108#post-944768 |  Stretches the display horizontally to your screen. | # is a number (decimal). Works only in PAL and NTSC modes. Default value : 2559. Increase it to stretch the screen on the right, decrease it for the left. Not compatible with $480p. |
| $"DWCROP_####":https://assemblergames.com/threads/ps2-pops-stuff-popstarter.45347/page-108#post-944768 | Reduces/expands the display area width. | # is a number (decimal). Works only in PAL and NTSC modes. Maximum value : 2560. Decrease it to crop the screen on the right. Not compatible with $480p. |
| $HDTVFIX | Enables SetGsCrt hack. | Helps with the HDTVs that canâ€™t deal with the interlaced resolutions thru component (plain green screens and other rubbish displayed otherwise). Not compatible with some CRT TVs. |
