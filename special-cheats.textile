Some useful commands have been automated. Here are them :

| *Cheat Code* | *Description* | *Notes* |
| $SAFEMODE | Disables the cheat engine and only activate it after POPS has left the PS OSD. | Should be always ON. Some game codes do patch the memory area where the PS OSD is loaded, causing crashes and other garbage... |
| $CACHE1 | Makes POPS buffer 1 sector instead of 16. | |
| $COMPATIBILITY_0x## | Activates a compatibility mode. | ## is a hexadecimal value. You can write as many $COMPATIBILITY_0x## as you want. |
