h2. _Step-by-step :_ 

*a) Installing the emulator :*

Since POPS (the emulator) is copyrighted by SONY, it can not be redistributed with POPStarter. You have to find it. It’s made of 2 files (for SMB mode).

pre. 
POPS_IOX.PAK - MD5 : a625d0b3036823cdbf04a3c0e1648901

# Find and download POPS_IOX.PAK ;
# Create a directory named POPS in your PS2 shared folder ;
# Copy POPS_IOX.PAK into POPS directory you’ve just created.

*b) Installing your PS1 Games :*

POPStarter/POPS doesn’t support PS1 disc images as .iso – but only as .VCD.

# Create a disc image of your PS1 game as .BIN/.CUE;
# Drag & drop your .CUE file over CUE2POPS.EXE to convert your BIN/CUE disc image to .VCD file (you can convert several games at once by running BULK_CUE2POPS.BAT);
# Put your .VCD files in POPS directory of your PS2 shared folder.

*c) Installing POPStarter :*

# Edit the 2 .DAT files (syntax below) included with the network modules with your network settings;
# Create a directory named POPSTARTER in the root of your PS2 memory card and put the network modules and the .DAT files in it;
# Rename the POPStarter ELF as the name of your VCDs, replace the .VCD extension with a .ELF extension, add the SB. prefix (example : for running a VCD named “Crash Bandicoot (PAL).VCD”, the POPStarter ELF must be renamed as “SB.Crash Bandicoot (PAL).ELF”) ;
# Copy the ELFs where you want to run them from (example : mass:/POPSTARTER/SB.GAME.ELF).


Now, check your setup. It must be the same as this :

pre. 
mc#:/POPSTARTER/IPCONFIG.DAT
mc#:/POPSTARTER/SMBCONFIG.DAT
mc#:/POPSTARTER/poweroff.irx
mc#:/POPSTARTER/ps2dev9.irx
mc#:/POPSTARTER/smsutils.irx
mc#:/POPSTARTER/ps2ip.irx
mc#:/POPSTARTER/ps2smap.irx
mc#:/POPSTARTER/smbman.irx
smb0:/My Shared Folder/POPS/POPS_IOX.PAK
smb0:/My Shared Folder/POPS/GAME.VCD
mass:/POPSTARTER/SB.GAME.ELF

=> to launch your game, run SB.GAME.ELF. Need help ? Ask over at "ASSEMblergames":https://assemblergames.com/threads/ps2-pops-stuff.45347/.

pre. 
192.168.0.254 My Shared Folder
MyName
MyPassword

For guest access, don’t write anything to line 2 and 3.

* *IPCONFIG.DAT syntax :*

In a single line : 

pre. 
PS2 IP ADDRESS space NETMASK space GATEWAY
