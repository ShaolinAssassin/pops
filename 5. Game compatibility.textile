h3. _Compatibility modes :_ 

| *Compatibility mode* | *Description* | 
| 0×01 | helps restoring the music/voices in several games | 
| 0x02 | a variant of mode 0×01, with a second hack for not breaking the MDECoding of FMVs (was designed for the Colony Wars series) | 
| 0x03 | can be used if the mode 0×01 doesn’t provide the expected results | 
| 0x04 | prevents the emulator from writing a garbage value in two of the virtual GPU registers (fixes slowdowns, flickering, and many other glitches) | 
| 0x05 | made for fixing the cutscenes of the PAL Resident Evil: Director’s Cut | 
| 0x06 | isables the OSD shell of the emulator’s built-in BIOS, making some games that freeze on startup run |
