h1. *Introduction to POPStarter rev13 - unofficial documentation*

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

h2. _Disclaimer :_ 

POPStarter is a launcher which lets you play your PS1 games in combination with $ony's PS1 emulator for PS2 (known as "POPS" or "SLBB-00001"). Unlike the previous POPStarter versions and the proofs of concept, POPStarter r13 does NOT contain the emulator itself or libraries that belong to $ony. It is safe to publish in forums/sites that don't tolerate warez stuff, as long as it's not repacked with the decrypted emulator files or things like a PS BIOS.

POPStarter is available for free download. If you spent an outrageous amount of money in ordering a HDD that contains preinstalled games and POPStarter, YOU HAVE BEEN ROBBED. Never purchase a physical copy of POPStarter when the "seller" wants more $$$ than the media price and the shipping fees.

h2. _Quickstart guides :_ 

Since this documentation is growing - a lot - as POPStarter is developped, I felt that new users could be over either too bored to read the whole documentation or overwhelmed by too much informations at the same time. So I wrote 3 quickstart guides, whose explain how to set-up POPStarter quickly.


*UPDATE 10-01-2017 :* 

I've been told by krHACKen that the last POPStarter beta (*Revision 13, WIP 06, OBT 16*) can be considered stable enough to be used as daily gaming version. So I updated the quickstart guides accordingly, and created the SMB guide.
