h1. *Introduction to POPStarter rev13 - Official documentation*

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

h2. _Disclaimer :_ 

POPStarter is a launcher which lets you play your PS1 games in combination with $ony's PS1 emulator for PS2 (known as "POPS" or "SLBB-00001"). Unlike the previous POPStarter versions and the proofs of concept, POPStarter r13 does NOT contain the emulator itself or libraries that belong to $ony. It is safe to publish in forums/sites that don't tolerate warez stuff, as long as it's not repacked with the decrypted emulator files or things like a PS BIOS.

POPStarter is available for free download. If you spent an outrageous amount of money in ordering a HDD that contains preinstalled games and POPStarter, YOU HAVE BEEN ROBBED. Never purchase a physical copy of POPStarter when the "seller" wants more $$$ than the media price and the shipping fees.

* *FINAL RELEASE :* *"POPStarter Revision 13 RIP 06 (2017/10/20)":https://bitbucket.org/ShaolinAssassin/popstarter-documentation-stuff/downloads/POPStarter_r13_RIP_06.zip*

pre. 
- Code cleanup
- USBD and USBHDFSD drivers reverted to builds from WIP 02
Since the drivers from prototype 2 reduced performances in BOTH POPStarter and POPS.
- Bugfixed : POPStarter wasn't loading MODULE_#.IRX.
Massive thanks to ShaolinAssassin for helping me to find what was broken.
- POPStarter now accepts PS2CD and PS2CDDA disc types.
In other words, you can now perform the disc swap trick with a pressed PS2 CDROM, in uLE or Swap Magic for example.
Your original disc (PS1/PS2) track 1 (data track) must have an equal or bigger TOC than the track 1 of your backup.
- Automated $COMPATIBILITY_0x05 for Resident Evil SLES-00200/SLES-00227/SLES-00228 as requested.

h2. _Quickstart guides :_ 

Since this documentation is growing - a lot - as POPStarter is developped, I felt that new users could be over either too bored to read the whole documentation or overwhelmed by too much informations at the same time. So I wrote 3 quickstart guides, whose explain how to set-up POPStarter quickly.

I've been told by krHACKen that *Rev 13 WIP 06 Beta 16* can be considered stable enough to be used as daily gaming version. So I updated the quickstart guides accordingly and created the SMB guide.
