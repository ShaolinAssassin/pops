h1. *Introduction to POPStarter rev13 - unofficial documentation*


______________________________________________________________________________________________________________



h2. _Disclaimer :_ 

POPStarter is a launcher which lets you play your PS1 games in combination with $ony's PS1 emulator for PS2 (known as "POPS" or "SLBB-00001"). Unlike the previous POPStarter versions and the proofs of concept, POPStarter r13 does NOT contain the emulator itself or libraries that belong to $ony. It is safe to publish in forums/sites that don't tolerate warez stuff, as long as it's not repacked with the decrypted emulator files or things like a PS BIOS.

POPStarter is available for free download. If you spent an outrageous amount of money in ordering a HDD that contains preinstalled games and POPStarter, YOU HAVE BEEN ROBBED. Never purchase a physical copy of POPStarter when the "seller" wants more $$$ than the media price and the shipping fees.

_Changelog [WIP 06, OBT 15]_

pre. 
- The CD lid open/close emulation is now complete. It refreshes the TOC.
  I'm still unsure about the correctness of the CDROM status and mode field values that are used though.
  This feature pokes the CDROM registers according to the lid open/close state and issues a VCD init RPC call 
to the IOPCD driver. W00t.
- Disc change support, alongside the CD lid open/close emulation mentioned above.
  This feature uses a DISCS.TXT file handler and parser, and separate VCDs.
- Static SetGsCrt interlace parameter, to help with the HDTVs that can't deal with the interlaced resolutions 
thru component.
  At least it does work with my crappy led TV. Without it, the said crappy TV keeps displaying plain green screens and other rubbish.
- Added a GS DISPLAY1/DISPLAY2 value calculator to the unfinished ($ONY's) 480p mode of POPS. 480p output can be enabled with the command $480p in CHEATS.TXT.
  I haven't found a way to stretch the display area width (damn these black boarders). Some games (like Dead Or Alive) output an odd signal that make them UNPLAYABLE (monitor says "unsupported" hmm).
- Added a couple of CHEATS.TXT commands ($XPOS_decimal and $YPOS_decimal) to adjust the X/Y position in NTSC and PAL modes.
  Let's say the picture of your NTSC game is badly shifted on the right. Then write $XPOS_604 to your CHEATS.TXT file and check out the result.
- Bugfixes to the MODULE_#.IRX loader, the usbd.irx/usbhdfsd.irx loader and the CHEATS.TXT parser.
  Yelling the f-word three times.
- The MODULE_#.IRX loader scans the user's files and disables the modules with matching names from POPS.
  Kills the embedded SIO2MAN/PADMAN/LIBSD/SDRDRV/DEV9/ATAD/HDD/PFS drivers on purpose, so only yours stay resident and active.
- A multitap initialization function was added to the MODULE_#.IRX loader. It's invoked as soon as the user mtapman/freemtap driver is loaded.
  HAXing into the cold of the fog. Since I don't own a multitap, I cannot give it a try. Although, I'd bet it's useless and doesn't make it work.
- A game fix was added to make all the retail versions of Parasite Eve II run.
  ... it's missing sounds. BGMs or SFX or both... Haven't played it in depth...
- A game fix was added to make the PAL version of Spyro 2 run.
  ... still crashes loading certain levels and the demo mode, like POPS is going crazy with the LibCrypt crapola.

h2. _Quickstart guides :_ 

Since this documentation is growing - a lot - as POPStarter is developped, I felt that new users could be over either too bored to read the whole documentation or overwhelmed by too much informations at the same time. So I wrote 2 quickstart guides, whose explain how to set-up POPStarter quickly.

These guides use last POPStarter *STABLE* version [Rev 13, WIP 05] - so there is no quickstart guide for SMB ATM (until the next stable version).
