h1. *BIOS & OSD Handlers*


______________________________________________________________________________________________________________


h2. _BIOS handler :_ 


You can use a PlayStation BIOS dump with POPS. Rename you dump as BIOS.BIN, place it in the VMC directory (example : __common/POPS/PBPX-95000.MY_GAME/BIOS.BIN) and POPStarter will use it for this game. You can also put it in the POPS folder, so it will be used for all games. If no BIOS are found in VMC directory or POPS folder, POPS will use its built-in BIOS.
Though using a BIOS with a game doesn't improve compatibility, you can use that feature to manage your MC, listen your CDDA game tracks...

h2. _OSD handler :_ 


If you put an OSD replacement image in the VMC directory (or in POPS folder), named as "OSD.BIN" (example : __common/POPS/PBPX-95000.MY_GAME/OSD.BIN), it will be injected in the built-in BIOS for POPS to run it.
When using a OSD replacement file, "BIOS.BIN" is ignored.
