h1. *Game Compatibility*


______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

POPS is able to emulate a large range of games perfectly fine with the POPStarter fixes - which makes it superior to "PS2PSXE":http://psx-scene.com/forums/f292/ps2psxe-public-preview-feedback-discussions-64878/. Best results are expected in internal HDD mode. 
Unfortunately, some famous and epic games are still unplayable. Here's a short list of them :
* Crash Bash (extreme flickering) ;
* Tekken 3 (extreme flickering) :
* Spyro 2 & 3 (crashes) ;
* Gran Turismo 2 (black cars) ;
* Dino Crisis (crashes) ;
* Parasite Eve II (crashes, and no SFX/music until a cutscene is played) ;
* Resident Evil 3 (random crashes).

h2. _Compatibility modes :_ 

If your game is poorly emulated, you can try to enable a compatibility mode to see if it helps.

| *Compatibility mode* | *Description* |
| 0×01 | Helps restoring the music/voices in several games. |
| 0x02 | A variant of mode 0×01, with a second hack for not breaking the MDECoding of FMVs (was designed for the Colony Wars series). |
| 0x03 | Can be used if the mode 0×01 doesn’t provide the expected results. |
| 0x04 | Fixes slowdowns, flickering, and many other glitches (prevents the emulator from writing a garbage value in two of the virtual GPU registers). |
| 0x05 | Made for fixing the cutscenes of the PAL Resident Evil: Director’s Cut. |
| 0x06 | Disables the OSD shell of the emulator’s built-in BIOS, making some games that freeze on startup run. |
| 0x07 | Fixes the missing textures problems (example : "Tomb Raider III":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LmGlgY_rNs&feature=youtu.be ). Unfinished. |

*Caution :* Modes 0x01, 0x02, 0x03 and 0x05 cannot be enabled in the same time or combined. These are variants of the same hack and they are conflicting, so use only use one of them at a time. Please let us know (at "ASSEMblergames":https://assemblergames.com/threads/ps2-pops-stuff.45347/) if you managed to solve a problem in your game by forcing modes, so the fix can be integrated in POPStarter.

*How to use a mode :*

* using a PATCH_X.BIN file from the compatibility mode archive : get the "compatibility mode archive":https://bitbucket.org/ShaolinAssassin/popstarter-documentation-stuff/downloads/Compatibility_Modes.7z, copy the PATCH file in the VMC directory of your problematic game then test the game. If the compatibility mode doesn't solve any problem in your game, delete the PATCH file from the VMC directory and redo the operations with the next PATCH file.
* using a CHEATS.TXT file : see the "cheat engine":https://bitbucket.org/ShaolinAssassin/popstarter-documentation-stuff/wiki/cheat-engine section to know how to enable a mode using the cheat engine.
* hardcoding the mode in POPStarter (advanced) : see "POPStarter configuration table":https://bitbucket.org/ShaolinAssassin/popstarter-documentation-stuff/wiki/configuration-table.

*Note :* if your game lags badly or stalls randomly and mode 0x04 doesn't fix that, you can try to use "$CODECACHE_ADDON_0 command":https://bitbucket.org/ShaolinAssassin/popstarter-documentation-stuff/wiki/edit/special-cheats in a GAME/CHEATS.TXT file. Do not use it by default on all your games, because most games will stop working with it.

h2. _Automated fixes :_ 

POPStarter has an "internal database":https://bitbucket.org/ShaolinAssassin/popstarter-documentation-stuff/wiki/automated containing various fixes (compatibility modes, LibCrypt cracks and miscellaneous fixes) for a big amount of games. These fixes will be automatically applied to your game, as long as you use proper dumps (for identification).
