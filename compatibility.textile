h1. *Game Compatibility*


______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

POPS is able to emulate a large range of games perfectly fine with the POPStarter fixes - which makes it superior to "PS2PSXE":http://psx-scene.com/forums/f292/ps2psxe-public-preview-feedback-discussions-64878/. Best results are expected in internal HDD mode. 
Unfortunately, some famous and epic games are still unplayable. Here's a short list of them :
* Crash Bash (extreme flickering) ;
* Tekken 3 (extreme flickering) :
* Spyro 2 & 3 (crashes) ;
* Gran Turismo 2 (black cars) ;
* Dino Crisis (crashes) ;
* Parasite Eve II (crashes, and no SFX/music until a cutscene is played) ;
* Resident Evil 3 (random crashes).


h2. _Compatibility lists and forms :_

h2. _Compatibility modes :_ 

If your game is poorly emulated, you can enable a compatibility mode to try to fix your issue.

| *Compatibility mode* | *Description* |
| *0×01* | Helps restoring the music/voices in several games. |
| *0x02* | A variant of mode 0×01, with a second hack for not breaking the MDECoding of FMVs (was designed for the Colony Wars series). |
| *0x03* | Can be used if the mode 0×01 doesn’t provide the expected results. |
| *0x04* | Fixes slowdowns, flickering, and many other glitches (prevents the emulator from writing a garbage value in two of the virtual GPU registers). |
| *0x05* | Made for fixing the cutscenes of the PAL Resident Evil: Director’s Cut. |
| *0x06* | Disables the OSD shell of the emulator’s built-in BIOS, making some games that freeze on startup run. |
| *0x07* | Fixes the missing textures problems (example : "Tomb Raider III":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LmGlgY_rNs&feature=youtu.be ). Unfinished (breaks the gamma). |

*Notes :* 
* Modes 0x01, 0x02, 0x03 and 0x05 cannot be enabled in the same time or combined. These are variants of the same hack and they are conflicting, so use only use one of them at a time. 

*How to enable a compatibility mode :*

* using a PATCH_#.BIN file from the "compatibility mode archive":https://bitbucket.org/ShaolinAssassin/popstarter-documentation-stuff/downloads/Compatibility_Modes.7z : place the PATCH_#.BIN file in the VMC directory of your problematic game and test. 
* using a CHEATS.TXT file : see the "cheat engine":https://bitbucket.org/ShaolinAssassin/popstarter-documentation-stuff/wiki/cheat-engine section to know how to enable a mode using the cheat engine.
* hardcoding the mode in POPStarter (advanced user) : read "POPStarter configuration table":https://bitbucket.org/ShaolinAssassin/popstarter-documentation-stuff/wiki/configuration-table.

*Note :* if your game lags badly or stalls randomly and that mode 0x04 doesn't fix that, you can try to use "$CODECACHE_ADDON_0 command":https://bitbucket.org/ShaolinAssassin/popstarter-documentation-stuff/wiki/edit/special-cheats in a GAME/CHEATS.TXT file. Do not use it by default on all your games because most games will stop working with it.

h2. _Automated fixes :_ 

POPStarter has an "internal database":https://bitbucket.org/ShaolinAssassin/popstarter-documentation-stuff/wiki/automated containing various fixes (compatibility modes, LibCrypt cracks and miscellaneous fixes) for a big amount of games. These fixes will be automatically applied to your game, as long as you use proper dumps (for identification).
