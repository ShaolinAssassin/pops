Though this is not a part of the POPStarter project, it worthes to be mentionned. Guys from "PCSX2 forum":http://forums.pcsx2.net found how to create widescreen codes/patches for PlayStation 1 games. 
You can download these patches "here":http://forums.pcsx2.net/Thread-PSOne-Widescreen-Patches?pid=477709#pid477709. 
Thanks to El_Patas for keeping the archive updated ; credits for these codes go to their authors. 

*Note :* these files are "_almost-ready-to-use_" with POPStarter = you need to add the "$" symbol.
