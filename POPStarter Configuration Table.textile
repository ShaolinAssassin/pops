h1. *POPStarter Configuration Table*


______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
_[From wip05 documentation]_

This documentation concerns the advanced configuration of POPStarter r13, involving the harcoding (or the patch-on-load) of settings to the POPStarter ELF/KELF...

The POPStarter r13 ELF and KELF have a 32 bytes long configuration table, starting from the offset $410 (or 1040 in decimal).

* *Caution* : Unless you know exactly what it is for and what you're doing, please don't tamper with it. Perhaps a GUI or a bunch of PPFs will surface, but for now the hexediting of that stuff is for advanced users only... Make a backup of the default config before you start changing values.

| *Offset* | *Description* | *Values* | *Notes* |
| *$410* | Display of the debug texts/pages | 0x00 = disables the debug printing |  |
|   |   | 0x01 < X < 0xFF =  defines the delay between each page of texts | The higher the value is, the longer the delay is  |
|   |   | 0xFF =  the debug texts are displayed in realtime without delay (like in POPStarter 12 and lower)|   |
| *$411* | Break the POPStarter execution after an error has occured | 0x00 = POPStarter prints the error message for a short time, then it kicks the user to the OSD.|   |
|   |   | 0x0X POPStarter prints the error message and sleeps on that screen indefinitely  |   |
| *$412* | NOT USED |  |  |
| *$413* | USB access delay, after the execution of the POPStarter embedded USB modules | 0x02 should be fine. Increase the value if POPStarter fails to access your USB device |  |
| *$414* | RESERVED (in USB operation mode) | Must be 0x40 |  |
| *$415* | User ID for individual VMCs | If set to 0x00, the function is disabled. | For assigning an ID to the couple of VMC, the value must be an ASCII character of "0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8" or "9" |
| *$416* | POPS dev9 module loading (in USB operation mode) | 0x00 = Let POPS load it Default is 0x03. If you need to wake the NIC up (for debugging stuff for example), set this to 0x00 |   |
|   |   | 0x03 = Forbids its loading |   |
| *$417* | NOT USED |  |  |
| *$418* | Force a single compatibility mode | 0x00 = No compatibility mode is forced |  |
|   |   | 0x0X = the respective compatibility mode is forced and the automatic activator gets disabled |   |
| *$419* | Force a single compatibility mode | 0x00 = No compatibility mode is forced |  |
|   |   | 0x0X = the respective compatibility mode is forced and the automatic activator gets disabled |   |
| *$41A* | Force a single compatibility mode | 0x00 = No compatibility mode is forced |  |
|   |   | 0x0X = the respective compatibility mode is forced and the automatic activator gets disabled |   |
| *$41B* | Force a single compatibility mode | 0x00 = No compatibility mode is forced |  |
|   |   | 0x0X = the respective compatibility mode is forced and the automatic activator gets disabled |   |
| *$41C* | Force a single compatibility mode | 0x00 = No compatibility mode is forced |  |
|   |   | 0x0X = the respective compatibility mode is forced and the automatic activator gets disabled |   |
| *$41D* | Force a single compatibility mode | 0x00 = No compatibility mode is forced |  |
|   |   | 0x0X = the respective compatibility mode is forced and the automatic activator gets disabled |   |
| *$41E* | Force a single compatibility mode | 0x00 = No compatibility mode is forced |  |
|   |   | 0x0X = the respective compatibility mode is forced and the automatic activator gets disabled |   |
| *$41F* | Force a single compatibility mode | 0x00 = No compatibility mode is forced |  |
|   |   | 0x0X = the respective compatibility mode is forced and the automatic activator gets disabled |   |
| *$420* | Patch the genuine HDD check | 0x00 = Don't patch | Totally useless. When running in a PS2, a homebrew ATAD is used. When running in a PSX, the original POPS ATAD is used. Leave it to 0x01 |
|   |   | 0x01 = Patch |   |
| *$421* | Loading and execution of the OSD shell of the POPS built-in BIOS | 0x00 = Load in the user memory and execute (don't patch anything) | 0x01 has the same effect as the compatibility mode 0x06. Skips the CD checks and the PS logo. Both don't work if the user uses a BIOS.BIN |
|   |   | 0x01 = Don't load, don't execute |   |
| *$422* | Exception breakpoints control | 0x00 = Break the emulator (don't patch anything) | 0x01 NOPs the break instructions of the 2nd-stage exception handler, allowing the user to trigger IGR after the emulation has crashed (in a few cases) |
|   |   | 0x01 = Don't break the emulator |   |
| *$423* | Original SLBB-00001 disc0 integrity check control | 0x00 = Don't skip the integrity check |  |
|   |   | 0x01 = Skip the integrity check |   |
| *$424* | IGR exit method | 0x00 = Original SLBB-00001+PSBBN method | 0x00 causes the emulator to read the MBR by its own, without flushing the cache and without resetting the IOP. Crashy for most users. |
|   |   | 0x01 = POPStarter r13 method |   |
| *$425* | IOPCD stack size (in USB operation mode)| 0x00 = Don't patch |   |
|   |   | 0x01 = Patch|   |
| *$426* | Delcro's patches (in USB operation mode) | 0x00 = Don't apply those to POPS |   |   
|   |   | 0x01 = Apply those to POPS |   |
| *$427* | Emulator modules loading failure | 0x00 = Don't patch (Kick to the PS2 OSD) | For your h4x0ring needz. . Patch it so you no longer have to care about the returned code of your injected IRX. |
|   |   | 0x01 = Patch (Ignore and continue)|   |
| *$428* | Internal HDD initialization failure | 0x00 = Don't patch (Kick to the PS2 OSD) | For your h4x0ring needz.  |
|   |   | 0x01 = Patch (Ignore and continue)|   |
| *$429* | Virtual Memory Cards control | 0x00 = Use both VMCs |
|   |   | 0x01 = Don't use VMCs at all |   |
|   |   | 0x02 = Use just the first VMC in the first virtual slot |   |
| *$42A* | Automatic PAL patch upon European VCD recognition | 0x00 = Disabled | The Automatic PAL Patcher of POPStarter expects "Euro" at the offset $102514 of the VCD |
|   |   | 0x01 = Enabled |   |
| *$42B* | Resident modules loader | 0x00 = Disabled | POPS/MODULE_0.IRX POPS/MODULE_1.IRX... up to POPS/MODULE_9.IRX. Are executed AFTER the IOP gets reset with IOPRP252.IMG, for Great Justice. |
|   |   | 0x01 = Enabled |   |
| *$42C* | Software PowerOff fix | 0x00 = Disabled | Can't remember what it is. Perhaps it's a redundant option of a deimplemented function... Prolific, mass ? |
|   |   | 0x01 = Enabled |   |
| *$42D* | IGR textures loader | 0x00 = Disabled | POPS/IGR_BG.TM2 POPS/IGR_NO.TM2 POPS/IGR_YES.TM2 |
|   |   | 0x01 = Enabled |   |
| *$42E* | Game license/region check of the POPS built-in BIOS| 0x00 = Leave unpatched | The patch just NOPs the loop. The PS logo is not shown when a non-JAP game is run. |
|   |   | 0x01 = Patch it so it does not loop the check when the VCD isn't NTSC J |   |
| *$42F* | POPStarter automatic compatibility mode activator | 0x00 = Do not enable anything | If set to 0x03 and a compatibility mode is forced, it will be changed to 0x02 automatically (applies the forced modes and not the automatic ones) |
|   |   | 0x01 = Enable the automatic compatibility modes activation |   |
|   |   | 0x02 = Enable the other subroutines (like LibCrypt cracks, when available) |   |
|   |   | 0x03 = Enable all |   |
