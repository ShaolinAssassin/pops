h1. *Convert your PS1 games to VCD format*



______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

h2. _VCD creation :_ 


POPS uses virtual CDROM format (.VCD). You need to create a 1:1 image of your PS1 game, first in .BIN+.CUE format using your favorite dump software, then to .VCD. 

Your .BIN image must be a raw MODE2/2352 dump and the .CUE a standard ASCII cuesheet. Open the .CUE file in a text editor and check the first line. If you can see "MODE2/2352", it's ok. 
 
* *How to convert to .VCD :*

To convert your PS1 games from .BIN+.CUE to .VCD, you need to use the last version of "CUE2POPS":https://bitbucket.org/ShaolinAssassin/popstarter-documentation-stuff/wiki/debug_mode

# Put your .BIN+.CUE image in the CUE2POPS folder. 
# Drag & drop your .CUE file on the BULK_CUE2POPS.BAT file. 
# A .VCD image of your game will be created in the folder. 


*Notes :* 

* CUE2POPS is a part of Toolbox soft, which can do more than only convert your games to .VCD. For a complete description of Toolbox, see "here":https://bitbucket.org/ShaolinAssassin/popstarter-documentation-stuff/wiki/Toolbox%20commands
* Linux users, you can get CUE2POPS src code with changes made for Linux "here":https://bitbucket.org/ShaolinAssassin/popstarter-documentation-stuff/downloads/cue2pops_src_linux.zip Download gcc with your distributions package manager and compile the file (SovietStriker @"ASSEMblergames":http://assemblergames.com/l/threads/ps2-pops-stuff.45347/page-55#post-792589)

h2. _Multi-disc games :_ 

[OBSOLETE]

POPS doesn't have a swap disc feature. To play multi-disc games, you need to combine the several discs of your game into a single .BIN+.CUE files using a "kit":https://app.box.com/s/b02715f2fe91cdc42fd1 made by guys @"ngemu":http://ngemu.com/threads/disc-combining-kits.118402/, then convert it using Toolbox.

*Notes :*
* It's possible that the game doesn't work after being combined & converted. 
* If this method doesn't work, you can make a save just before the end of the disc 1, extract your save from the VMC, continue your game on PS1 PC emulator or PS1 retail console, save again after the launch of the 2nd disc, import your save to the VMC and continue your game with POPS (you will need 2 .VCD of your game, one for each disc).
