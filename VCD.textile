h1. *Convert your PS1 games to VCD format*



______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

h2. _Toolbox :_ 


POPS uses virtual CDROM format (.VCD). You need to create a 1:1 image of your PS1 game, first in .BIN+.CUE format using your favorite dump software, then to .VCD using "Toolbox":https://bitbucket.org/ShaolinAssassin/popstarter-documentation-stuff/downloads/ToolBox.zip. 

Your .BIN image must be a raw MODE2/2352 dump and the .CUE a standard ASCII cuesheet. Open the .CUE file in a text editor and check the first line. If you can see "MODE2/2352", it's ok. 
 
* *Simple & quick :*

# Put your .BIN+.CUE image in the Toolbox folder. 
# Drag & drop your .CUE file on the CUE2POPS.BAT file. 
# A .VCD image of your game will be created in the folder. 

* *Toolbox commands :* "here":https://bitbucket.org/ShaolinAssassin/popstarter-documentation-stuff/wiki/Toolbox%20commands.


*Note :* 
* If your .CUE is missing, you can download an archive (lot of PS1 .CUEs) from "here":http://redump.org/cues/psx/ (do not forget that names of .BIN & .CUE must match. Ex : Driver.bin & Driver.cue. Rename your .BIN, as maybe the .CUE you downloaded has info inside about CD tracks). 
* Linux users, you can get CUE2POPS src code with changes made for Linux "here":https://bitbucket.org/ShaolinAssassin/popstarter-documentation-stuff/downloads/cue2pops_src_linux.zip Download gcc with your distributions package manager and compile the file (SovietStriker @"ASSEMblergames":http://assemblergames.com/l/threads/ps2-pops-stuff.45347/page-55#post-792589)

h2. _Multi-disc games :_ 

POPS doesn't have a swap disc feature. To play multi-disc games, you need to combine the several discs of your game into a single .BIN+.CUE files using a "kit":https://app.box.com/s/b02715f2fe91cdc42fd1, then convert it using Toolbox. 

*Notes :*
* It's possible that the game doesn't work after being combined & converted. 
* Toolbox can handle such large .BIN+.CUE files, while CUE2POPS (old version) can't.
* If this method doesn't work, you can make a save just before the end of the disc 1, extract your save from the VMC, continue your game on PS1 PC emulator or PS1 retail console, save again after the launch of the 2nd disc, import your save to the VMC and continue your game with POPS (you will need 2 .VCD of your game, one for each disc).
