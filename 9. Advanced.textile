This documentation concerns the advanced configuration of POPStarter r13, involving the harcoding (or the patch-on-load) of settings to the POPStarter ELF/KELF...

The POPStarter r13 ELF and KELF have a 32 bytes long configuration table, starting from the offset $410 (or 1040 in decimal).

Unless you know exactly what it is for and what you're doing, please don't tamper with it. Perhaps a GUI or a bunch of PPFs will surface, but for now the hexediting of that stuff is for advanced users only... Make a backup of the default config before you start changing values
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

*Offset $410 : Display of the debug texts/pages*
* A value of 0x00 disables the debug printing.
* A value between 0x01 and 0x0FF defines the delay between each page of texts. The higher the value is, the longer the delay is.
* When set to 0xFF, the debug texts are displayed in realtime without delay (like in POPStarter 12 and lower)
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

*Offset $411 : Break the POPStarter execution after an error has occured*
* When set to 0x00, POPStarter prints the error message for a short time, then it kicks the user to the OSD.
* When set to anything but 0x00, POPStarter prints the error message and sleeps on that screen indefinitely 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

*Offset $412 : Skip most POPStarter functions (NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED)*
* 0x00 == OFF
* 0x01 == Level 1
* 0x02 == Level 2
* Note  : That feature is not finished, I don't even know how it behaves atm. Use at your own risk.

*Offset $413 : USB access delay, after the execution of the POPStarter embedded USB modules*
* 0x02 should be fine. Increase the value if POPStarter fails to access your USB device
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

*Offset $414 : RESERVED (in USB operation mode)*
* Must be 0x40
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

*Offset $415 : User ID for individual VMCs*
* If set to 0x00, the function is disabled.
*  For assigning an ID to the couple of VMC, the value must be an ASCII character of "0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8" or "9"

*Offset $416 : POPS dev9 module loading (in USB operation mode)*
