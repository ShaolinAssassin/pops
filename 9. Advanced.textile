h1. *Advanced*
______________________________________________________________________


This documentation concerns the advanced configuration of POPStarter r13, involving the harcoding (or the patch-on-load) of settings to the POPStarter ELF/KELF...

The POPStarter r13 ELF and KELF have a 32 bytes long configuration table, starting from the offset $410 (or 1040 in decimal).
Unless you know exactly what it is for and what you're doing, please don't tamper with it.
Perhaps a GUI or a bunch of PPFs will surface, but for now the hexediting of that stuff is for advanced users only...
Make a backup of the default config before you start changing values


_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Offset $410 : Display of the debug texts/pages
              A value of 0x00 disables the debug printing.
              A value between 0x01 and 0x0FF defines the delay between each page of texts. The higher the value is, the longer the delay is.
              When set to 0xFF, the debug texts are displayed in realtime without delay (like in POPStarter 12 and lower)
______________________________________________________________________

Offset $411 : Break the POPStarter execution after an error has occured.
              When set to 0x00, POPStarter prints the error message for a short time, then it kicks the user to the OSD.
              When set to anything but 0x00, POPStarter prints the error message and sleeps on that screen indefinitely 

______________________________________________________________________

Offset $412 : Skip most POPStarter functions (NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED)
              0x00 == OFF
              0x01 == Level 1
              0x02 == Level 2
              Note  : That feature is not finished, I don't even know how it behaves atm. Use at your own risk.

______________________________________________________________________


Offset $413 : USB access delay, after the execution of the POPStarter embedded USB modules
              0x02 should be fine. Increase the value if POPStarter fails to access your USB device

______________________________________________________________________


Offset $414 : RESERVED (in USB operation mode)
              Must be 0x40

______________________________________________________________________

Offset $415 : User ID for individual VMCs
              If set to 0x00, the function is disabled.
              For assigning an ID to the couple of VMC, the value must be an ASCII character of "0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8" or "9"

______________________________________________________________________

Offset $416 : POPS dev9 module loading (in USB operation mode)
              0x00 == Let POPS load it
              0x03 == Forbids its loading
              Default is 0x03. If you need to wake the NIC up (for debugging stuff for example), set this to 0x00

Offset $417 : NOT USED

______________________________________________________________________


Offset $418 : Force a single compatibility mode
              If set to 0x00, no compatibility mode is forced
              Else, if set to a value between 0x00 and 0x07, the respective compatibility mode is forced and the automatic activator gets disabled.


______________________________________________________________________


Offset $419 : Force a single compatibility mode
              If set to 0x00, no compatibility mode is forced
              Else, if set to a value between 0x00 and 0x07, the respective compatibility mode is forced and the automatic activator gets disabled.

______________________________________________________________________

Offset $41A : Force a single compatibility mode
              If set to 0x00, no compatibility mode is forced
              Else, if set to a value between 0x00 and 0x07, the respective compatibility mode is forced and the automatic activator gets disabled.
______________________________________________________________________

Offset $41B : Force a single compatibility mode
              If set to 0x00, no compatibility mode is forced
              Else, if set to a value between 0x00 and 0x07, the respective compatibility mode is forced and the automatic activator gets disabled.
______________________________________________________________________

Offset $41C : Force a single compatibility mode
              If set to 0x00, no compatibility mode is forced
              Else, if set to a value between 0x00 and 0x07, the respective compatibility mode is forced and the automatic activator gets disabled.
______________________________________________________________________

Offset $41D : Force a single compatibility mode
              If set to 0x00, no compatibility mode is forced
              Else, if set to a value between 0x00 and 0x07, the respective compatibility mode is forced and the automatic activator gets disabled.
______________________________________________________________________

Offset $41E : Force a single compatibility mode
              If set to 0x00, no compatibility mode is forced
              Else, if set to a value between 0x00 and 0x07, the respective compatibility mode is forced and the automatic activator gets disabled.
______________________________________________________________________

Offset $41F : Force a single compatibility mode
              If set to 0x00, no compatibility mode is forced
              Else, if set to a value between 0x00 and 0x07, the respective compatibility mode is forced and the automatic activator gets disabled.

______________________________________________________________________

Offset $420 : Patch the genuine HDD check
              0x00 == Don't patch
              0x01 == Patch
              Note  : Totally useless. When running in a PS2, a homebrew ATAD is used. When running in a PSX, the original POPS ATAD is used. Leave it to 0x01.
______________________________________________________________________

Offset $421 : Loading and execution of the OSD shell of the POPS built-in BIOS
              0x00 == Load in the user memory and execute (don't patch anything)
              0x01 == Don't load, don't execute
              Note  : 0x01 has the same effect as the compatibility mode 0x06. Skips the CD checks and the PS logo. Both don't work if the user uses a BIOS.BIN.
______________________________________________________________________

Offset $422 : Exception breakpoints control
              0x00 == Break the emulator (don't patch anything)
              0x01 == Don't break the emulator
              Note  : 0x01 NOPs the break instructions of the 2nd-stage exception handler, allowing the user to trigger IGR after the emulation has crashed (in a few cases)
______________________________________________________________________

Offset $423 : Original SLBB-00001 disc0 integrity check control
              0x00 == Don't skip the integrity check
              0x01 == Skip the integrity check
______________________________________________________________________

Offset $424 : IGR exit method
              0x00 == Original SLBB-00001+PSBBN method
              0x01 == POPStarter r13 method
              Note  : 0x00 causes the emulator to read the MBR by its own, without flushing the cache and without resetting the IOP. Crashy for most users.
______________________________________________________________________

Offset $425 : IOPCD stack size (in USB operation mode)
              0x00 == Don't patch
              0x01 == Patch
______________________________________________________________________

Offset $426 : Delcro's patches (in USB operation mode)
              0x00 == Don't apply those to POPS
              0x01 == Apply those to POPS
______________________________________________________________________

Offset $427 : Emulator modules loading failure
              0x00 == Don't patch (Kick to the PS2 OSD)
              0x01 == Patch (Ignore and continue)
              Note  : For your h4x0ring needz. Patch it so you no longer have to care about the returned code of your injected IRX.
______________________________________________________________________

Offset $428 : Internal HDD initialization failure
              0x00 == Don't patch (Kick to the PS2 OSD)
              0x01 == Patch (Ignore and continue)
              Note  : For your h4x0ring needz.
______________________________________________________________________

Offset $429 : Virtual Memory Cards control
              0x00 == Use both VMCs
              0x01 == Don't use VMCs at all
              0x02 == Use just the first VMC in the first virtual slot
______________________________________________________________________

Offset $42A : Automatic PAL patch upon European VCD recognition
              0x00 == Disabled
              0x01 == Enabled
              Note  : The Automatic PAL Patcher of POPStarter expects "Euro" at the offset $102514 of the VCD
______________________________________________________________________

Offset $42B : Resident modules loader
              0x00 == Disabled
              0x01 == Enabled
              Note  : POPS/MODULE_0.IRX POPS/MODULE_1.IRX... up to POPS/MODULE_9.IRX. Are executed AFTER the IOP gets reset with IOPRP252.IMG, for Great Justice.
______________________________________________________________________

Offset $42C : Software PowerOff fix
              0x00 == Disabled
              0x01 == Enabled
              Note  : Can't remember what it is. Perhaps it's a redundant option of a deimplemented function... Prolific, mass ?
______________________________________________________________________

Offset $42D : IGR textures loader
              0x00 == Disabled
              0x01 == Enabled
              Note  : POPS/IGR_BG.TM2 POPS/IGR_NO.TM2 POPS/IGR_YES.TM2
______________________________________________________________________

Offset $42E : Game license/region check of the POPS built-in BIOS
              0x00 == Leave unpatched
              0x01 == Patch it so it does not loop the check when the VCD isn't NTSC J
              Note  : The patch just NOPs the loop. The PS logo is not shown when a non-JAP game is run.
______________________________________________________________________

Offset $42F : POPStarter automatic compatibility mode activator
              0x00 == Do not enable anything
              0x01 == Enable the automatic compatibility modes activation
              0x02 == Enable the other subroutines (like LibCrypt cracks, when available)
              0x03 == Enable all
              Note  : If set to 0x03 and a compatibility mode is forced, it will be changed to 0x02 automatically (applies the forced modes and not the automatic ones)
