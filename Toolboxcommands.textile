h3. _*-lc :*_   

* _Tool name (version) :_ LC Crack Trojan Maker 

pre. 
Hello! I make TROJANs that crack your LibCrypt protected games.
The crack is applied to the POPS memory, so your VCD remains untouched.
1. Run your game in pSX/ePSXe/PCSX/Xebra (must have a genuine SBI or SUB)
2. Do a savestate as soon as it has gone past the LibCrypt thread
3. Decompress the savestate if it's compressed

* _Usage :_ :

pre. 
"toolbox.exe" -lc "input_file"

* _Notes :_  
input_file can be :
- a pSX Quicksave (PSV)
- a Xebra Running Image
- a PCSX Save State v3 (Uncompressed)
- a PCSX Save State v4 (Uncompressed)
- an ePSXe Save State (Uncompressed)
"(Uncompressed)" means that you must decompress it manually, using a gzip archiver such as 7-Zip...

h3. _*-vmode :*_  

* _Tool name (version) :_ PAL2NTSC Trojan Maker v1.0

pre. 
Hello! I make TROJANs that patch your games VMODE to NTSC.
The patch is applied to the POPS memory, so your VCD remains untouched.
Results are as horrible as what you got with the vmode function of the old CUE2POPS, because the display is not resized nor cropped to the NTSC resolution.
Games with multiple EXEs/routines are not supported.

* _Usage :_

pre. 
"toolbox.exe" -vmode "input_file"

pre.

- a PCSX Save State v4 (Uncompressed)
- a Xebra Running Image
- a PS-X Executable
- a PS-X RAM Dump
- a PS2 Kernel Memory Dump (POPS)
- a PS2 User Memory Dump (POPS)
"(Uncompressed)" means that you must decompress it manually, using a gzip archiver such as 7-Zip...
