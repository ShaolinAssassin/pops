h1. *POPStarter Features*


______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

h2. _General note :_

POPStarter is able to handle external files, so you can configure it's settings, even tho POPStarter is a GUI-less app. These external files come as TROJAN#BIN, PATCH#.BIN, BIOS.BIN, OSD.BIN, CHEATS.TXT, VMC.DIR...
These files can be placed into 2 different locations, POPS folder and the game VMC folder. 

As general rules : 
* if a TROJAN#BIN, PATCH#.BIN, BIOS.BIN, OSD.BIN, CHEATS.TXT, VMC.DIR, WHATEVER... is placed into POPS folder, it will be applied to ALL games in POPS folder;
* if a TROJAN#BIN, PATCH#.BIN, BIOS.BIN, OSD.BIN, CHEATS.TXT, VMC.DIR, WHATEVER... is placed into the game VMC folder, it will be applied to only this particular game;
* POPStarter can handle multiple external files at the same time;
* POPStarter can handle multiple external files at the same time from different locations

Ex : 


pre. 
POPS/PATCH1.BIN
POPS/Crash Bandicoot (VMC folder)/CHEATS.TXT
