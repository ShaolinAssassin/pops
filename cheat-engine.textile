h1. *Cheat Engine*


______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Since WIP06 OBT 01, POPStarter has an embedded cheat engine :

* codes will be stored into a txt file named CHEATS.TXT placed into the VMC game folder;
* each code line has to start with the $ character;
* each code line must have a space between the adress and the value;
* PS1 RAW codes of types 30, 50, 80 and D0 are supported (Gameshark/Action Replay);
* PS2 RAW codes of types 0, 1 and 2 are supported. 

Create a text file named CHEATS.TXT & place it into the VMC folder of your game. In this text file, write $, then your code in GameShark/Action Replay format. 

Ex : 

pre. 
$800AC402 0800

*Notes :* 

* Each game must have his own CHEATS.TXT file.
* Some PS1 games need mastercodes otherwise they crash (ex : Air Race Championship). Only type C0 are supported. Mastercodes of type C1 (aka activation on delay time) are not and will not be supported.
* You can enable a code for ALL your games if you place the CHEATS.TXT file in POPS folder instead of the VMC game folder.
* Massive PS1 codes list in PS2 RAW format - ready-to-use - can be found "here":https://bitbucket.org/ShaolinAssassin/popstarter-documentation-stuff/wiki/ps1-codes-in-ps2-raw-format.
* POPS Mastercode - for use with a PS2 cheat device (ps2rd, codebreaker, Cheat device...) is 902377F4 0C0902EF. You don't need it if you use CHEATS.TXT.
* To convert a PS1 code to PS2 RAW format,  add $01000000 to the adresses and comply with the code type definitions of the target PS2 cheat engine. For more info about how to convert codes, check this "post":http://assemblergames.com/l/threads/ps2-pops-stuff.45347/page-27#post-760915.
