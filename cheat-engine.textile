h1. *Cheat Engine*


______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

POPStarter has an embedded cheat engine that supports Gameshark/Action Replay PS1 codes (PS1 RAW codes of types 30, 50, 80 and D0 are supported). Some basic rules about the cheat engine : 

* codes will be stored into a txt file named CHEATS.TXT placed into the VMC game folder (each game will have his own dedicated CHEATS.TXT file) ;
* each code line has to start with the $ character otherwise the code is not enabled ;
* each code line must have a space between the adress and the value ;

*Example - Castlevania - Symphony of the Night (NTSC-U) :* 

pre. 
POPS/Castlevania - Symphony of the Night (NTSC-U)/CHEATS.TXT

CHEATS.TXT content : 

pre. 
$SAFEMODE
$80097BA0 270F // Infinite Health

*Notes :* 

* It is *highly recommended* to have to "$SAFEMODE command":https://bitbucket.org/ShaolinAssassin/popstarter-documentation-stuff/wiki/special-cheats code at the very first line of the CHEATS.TXT file ;
* Some PS1 games need mastercodes otherwise they crash (ex : Air Race Championship). Only type C0 are supported. Mastercodes of type C1 (aka activation on delay time) are not and will not be supported ;
* You can disable a code if your remove the $ character from the code ;
* You can enable a code for ALL your games if you place the CHEATS.TXT file in POPS folder instead of the VMC game folder ;
* You can find a list of useful generic commands "here":https://bitbucket.org/ShaolinAssassin/popstarter-documentation-stuff/wiki/special-cheats ;
* "Gamehacking.org":http://gamehacking.org/system/psx/all is a great place for PS1 cheats code.
