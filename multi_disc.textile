h1. *Change disc feature*

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Since OBT 15, POPStarter has a change-disc feature, that let you play multi-disc easily. 

# Create a DISCS.TXT text file containing the file names of your VCDs, one file name per line (with VCD extension) ;
# Copy this DISCS.TXT file to the VMC folders of all your game discs ;
# Open the lid using the hotkey ;
# Insert the disc you want to load using the hotkey ;
# Close the lid using the hotkey.

Hotkeys are :

* Select+L2+R2+Triangle To open the lid
* Select+L2+R2+Up To Insert Disc 1 (DISCS.TXT line 1)
* Select+L2+R2+Right To Insert Disc 2 (DISCS.TXT line 2)
* Select+L2+R2+Down To Insert Disc 3 (DISCS.TXT line 3)
* Select+L2+R2+Left To Insert Disc 4 (DISCS.TXT line 4)
* Select+L2+R2+Square To close the lid

Limitations are :

* Up to 4 file names in DISCS.TXT
* A file name must not exceed 89 characters
* The VCD files have to be in the same partition/folder

Example of working setup : 

pre. 
mass:/POPS/MGS_CD1.VCD   
mass:/POPS/MGS_CD2.VCD
mass:/POPS/XX.MGS_CD1.ELF
mass:/POPS/XX.MGS_CD2.ELF
mass:/POPS/MGS_CD1/DISCS.TXT
mass:/POPS/MGS_CD2/DISCS.TXT

In both DISCS.TXT files, you had to write : 

pre. 
MGS_CD1.VCD
MGS_CD2.VCD


You could also use the VMCDIR.TXT file to use only 1 pair of VMCs for this multi-disc game.

Example : 


pre. 
mass:/POPS/MGS.VCD
mass:/POPS/MGS_2.VCD
mass:/POPS/XX.MGS.ELF
mass:/POPS/MGS/DISCS.TXT
mass:/POPS/MGS/VMCDIR.TXT



In DISCS.TXT, you had to write : 

pre. 
MGS.VCD
MGS_2.VCD


In VMCDIR.TXT, you had to write : 

pre. 
MGS
