h1. *Change disc feature*

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Since OBT 15, POPStarter has a change-disc feature, that let you play multi-disc easily. 

# Create a DISCS.TXT text file containing the file names of your VCDs, one file name per line (with VCD extension) ;
# Copy this DISCS.TXT file to the VMC folders of all your game discs.

Hotkeys are :

* Select+L2+R2+Triangle To open the lid
* Select+L2+R2+Up To Insert Disc 1 (DISCS.TXT line 1)
* Select+L2+R2+Right To Insert Disc 2 (DISCS.TXT line 2)
* Select+L2+R2+Down To Insert Disc 3 (DISCS.TXT line 3)
* Select+L2+R2+Left To Insert Disc 4 (DISCS.TXT line 4)
* Select+L2+R2+Square To close the lid

Limitations are :

* Up to 4 file names in DISCS.TXT
* A file name must not exceed 89 characters
* The VCD files have to be in the same partition/folder

Example : 


pre. 
mass:/POPS/MGS_CD1.VCD   <
mass:/POPS/MGS_CD2.VCD
mass:/POPS/XX.MGS_CD1.ELF
mass:/POPS/XX.MGS_CD2.ELF
mass:/POPS/MGS_CD1/DISCS.TXT
mass:/POPS/MGS_CD2/DISCS.TXT

In both DISCS.TXT files, you had to write : 

pre. 
MGS_CD1.VCD
MGS_CD2.VCD
