h1. *Known bugs / limitations*



______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

* *$COMPATIBILITY_0x07 mode :* unfinished. 

* *$WIDESCREEN command :* unfinished.

* *Multi-disc support :* does not work properly with all games.

* *POPS USB oddities :* we found out that latest USBD and USBHDFSD drivers reduced performances in BOTH POPStarter and POPS - so USBD and USBHDFSD drivers embedded into POPStarter are quite old. You can use your own USB modules (named as usbd.irx & usbhdfsd.irx, case sensitive, lowercase, no file size restriction) from mc#:/POPSTARTER - but expect lower performances. 

* *PS1 CD mode :* we found out after RIP 06 release that the HDD old launch type method (PP.GAME.ELF or PP.PS1CD.ELF) "has a bug":https://assemblergames.com/threads/ps2-pops-stuff-popstarter.45347/page-112#post-952852 : files from __common/POPS folder (and from __common/POPS/GAME) will not be loaded.

* *"PS3 support :":https://assemblergames.com/threads/ps2-pops-stuff-popstarter.45347/page-105#post-936970* POPStarter test build works in a CECHA (no controller response on POPS tho).
