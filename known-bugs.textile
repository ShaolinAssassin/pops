h1. *Known bugs / limitations*



______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

* *$COMPATIBILITY_0x07 mode :* unfinished. 

* *$WIDESCREEN command :* unfinished.

* *Multi-disc support :* does not work properly with all games.

* *"POPS USB oddities :":https://assemblergames.com/threads/ps2-pops-stuff-popstarter.45347/page-109#post-950500* we found out that latest USBD and USBHDFSD drivers reduced performances in BOTH POPStarter and POPS - so USBD and USBHDFSD drivers embedded into POPStarter are quite old. You can use your own USB modules (named as usbd.irx & usbhdfsd.irx, case sensitive, lowercase, no file size restriction) from mc#:/POPSTARTER - but expect lower performances. 

* *"PS1 CD mode :":https://assemblergames.com/threads/ps2-pops-stuff-popstarter.45347/page-112#post-952852* we found out after RIP 06 release that the HDD old launch type method (PP.PS1CD.ELF or __.PS1CD.ELF) has a bug : files from __common/POPS folder (and from __common/POPS/PS1CD) will not be loaded.

* *"PS3 support :":https://assemblergames.com/threads/ps2-pops-stuff-popstarter.45347/page-105#post-936970* POPStarter test build works in a CECHA (no controller response on POPS tho).

* *"OPL blocked":http://www.psx-place.com/threads/open-ps2-loader-v0-9-3.13415/page-4#post-84429 :* POPStarter refuses to run from OPL, *by design*. It's not a bug, it's a feature * wink wink *.
