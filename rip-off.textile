You may find online some POPS-00001 and POPStarter bundles distributed by a guy named _psalmsamuel_. This guy is famous for distributing hexediting homebrews (FMCB "here":http://psx-scene.com/forums/f153/their-scammer-fmcb-115279/ or "here":https://assemblergames.com/threads/ps2-pops-stuff-popstarter.45347/page-18#post-686693 and "Open PS2 Loader":https://assemblergames.com/threads/ps2-pops-stuff-popstarter.45347/page-15#post-685142  for example...), removing splash screens/logos/credits, replacing texts by its own, spreading lies... He uses various nicknames : psalmsamuel, Yeshuachrist, The_Pot_Of_Greed...

You are strongly adviced to *NOT* use his stuff, as it was proved that is was nothing but "sabotage":https://assemblergames.com/threads/ps2-pops-stuff-popstarter.45347/page-14#post-684424 - which could ruin your PS2 stuff.
