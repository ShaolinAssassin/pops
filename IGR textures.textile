h2. _Make your own textures:_ 

Some piece of info from arkl1t32 about how to make you own IGR textures :


pre. 
1 editing background is easy and only .TM2 editor is needed.
2 editing select icons is litle tricky, you need 2 programs, .TM2 editor and HEX editor
use my NO YES files as a base to edit, they work, but remember black color for NO YES files is TRANSPARENT!! it's almost invisible! other colors are shown normaly
after editing you must open them by hex editor end DELETE last 8 digits in last offset like on this picture. And last offset must be 1DB0!
i dont know why byt saving file after edition in .tm2 editor, program writes those 8 empty fields so, they must be deleted again with hex editor
