______________________________________________________________________________________________________________


To install POPStarter in HDDOSD, you will need : 

. to use the first HDD launch type (1 game = 1 partition). You can't do it with the __.POPS partition. Your game partition will be a parent partition named PP.Name of my Game.
. to inject some files into the partition header, to make it bootable from HDDOSD + to display infos related to your game + to customize the icon shown in the HDDOSD. 

*Set-by-step :* 

*1.* [PS2] - First - if you don't have it yet - install POPS (copy/paste IOPRP252.IMG & POPS.ELF into __common/POPS/).

*2.* [PC] - Convert your game as .VCD file.

*3.* [PS2] - Using uLE_kHn, create a partition large enough to store your game. Name it as PP.Name of my Game. Example : PP.Cotton_Original. 

*4*. [PS2] - Transfer your VCD into your PP.Name of my Game partition and rename it IMAGE0.VCD. 

*5.* [PS2] - Rename POPStarter.KELF as EXECUTE.KELF and copy/paste it into your PP.Name of my Game.

Your files should look like this : 

pre. 
__common/POPS/IOPRP252.IMG
__common/POPS/POPS.ELF
PP.Cotton_Original/EXECUTE.KELF
PP.Cotton_Original/IMAGE0.VCD

Before you can inject the files into the partition hearder, you need to get them ready for your particular game.

*6.* [PC] - Download the sample files. The .7z includes : 

- system.cnf = this file tells the PS2 where to look at for launching POPStarter (BOOT2 = pfs:/EXECUTE.KELF in system.cnf means that the file that will be launched from HDDOSD is EXECUTE.KELF, placed into the root of the partition). Do not edit it, it's ready to use (don't bother about VMODE = NTSC in it, I'm also a PAL user and I never changed that and got it working).

- list.ico = this file is a PS2 icon, made by myself using my profile picture from PSX-scene. You can learn how to create your own icons "her":http://web.archive.org/web/20140401012522/http://sksapps.com/index.php?page=Creating_Icons_tutorial.html (very easy). If you want that HDDOSD displays a special image when you are about to delete a game/partition, repeat the process and name this file del.ico.

- icon.sys = this files contains the infos that will be displayed in the HDDOSD. You need to edit it and fill some info inside. Use Notepad++.  

pre. 
PS2X
title0=Cotton Original // What will be displayed on the first line of the HDDOSD. Can be anything. I choose the name of the game.
title1=[SLPM-86461] // What will be displayed on the 2nd line of the HDDOSD. Can be anything. I choose the <game_ID> of the game.
bgcola=0 // HDDOSD background color.
bgcol0=0,0,0 // Mixed color all bgcol changes the total color.
bgcol1=0,0,0
bgcol2=0,0,0
bgcol3=0,0,0
lightdir0=1.0,-1.0,1.0 // Lighting for on down.
lightdir1=-1.0,1.0,-1.0
lightdir2=0.0,0.0,0.0
lightcolamb=64,64,64
lightcol0=64,64,64
lightcol1=16,16,16
lightcol2=0,0,0
uninstallmes0= Voulez-vous supprimer ce jeu ? // Message displayed on screen when you are about to delete the game/partition.
uninstallmes1= //  I choose to translate the message in French.
uninstallmes2=

*7.* [PC] - So, create your icon(s) and edit icon.sys according to your will.

*8.* [PC] - Download AKuHAK’s reworked HDL_Dump zip folder, extract it at the root of your PC (C:), and delete boot.elf file from inside (it's miniopl - we don't need it).

*9.* [PC] - Drop your system.cnf, list.ico, icon.sys inside hdl_dumx folder. Hdl_dumx folder content : 

pre. 
- hdl_dumb.exe - no GUI version
- hdl_dump.exe - GUI version
- icon.sys 
- list.ico 
- system.cnf 

*10.* [PS2] - Connect your PS2 to your PC using a crossover cable, and launch hdl_svr_0.93.elf using uE from it.

*11.* [PC] - Launch command promt.

*12.* [PC] - Type :

pre. 
cd C:\hdl_dumx_rev47\

*13.* [PC] - then : 

pre. 
C:\hdl_dumx_rev47\hdl_dump.exe modify_header 192.168.0.5 PP.Cotton_Original

192.168.0.5 = your PS2 IP adress ;
PP.Cotton_Original = your partition.

*14.* [PC] - if you got it working you should get a message like this : 

pre. 
Succesfully read system.cnf = system.cnf injected into partition header
Succesfully read icon.sys
Succesfully read list.ico
Skipped del.ico = del.ico file missing from hdl_dumx folder
Skipped boot.kelf
Skipped boot.elf
Skipped boot.kirx

*15.* Done ! ;)
