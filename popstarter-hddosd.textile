To install POPStarter in HDDOSD, you will need : 

. to use the first HDD launch type (1 game = 1 partition). You can't do it with the __.POPS partition. Your game partition will be a parent partition named PP.Name_of_my_Game.
. to inject some files into the partition header, to make it bootable from HDDOSD + to display infos related to your game + to customize the icon shown in the HDDOSD. 

*Set-by-step :* 

*1.* [PS2] - First - if you don't have it yet - install POPS (copy/paste IOPRP252.IMG & POPS.ELF into __common/POPS/).

*2.* [PC] - Convert your game as .VCD file.

*3.* [PS2] - Using uLE_kHn, create a partition large enough to store your game. Name it as PP.Name_of_my_Game. Example : PP.Cotton_Original. (*! no "+" in the partition name, no whitespaces !*)

*4*. [PS2] - Transfer your VCD into your PP.Name of my Game partition and rename it IMAGE0.VCD. 

*5.* [PS2] - Rename POPStarter.KELF as EXECUTE.KELF and copy/paste it into your PP.Name of my Game.

Your files should look like this : 

pre. 
__common/POPS/IOPRP252.IMG
__common/POPS/POPS.ELF
PP.Cotton_Original/EXECUTE.KELF
PP.Cotton_Original/IMAGE0.VCD

Before you can inject the files into the partition hearder, you need to get them ready for your particular game.

*6.* [PC] - Download the "sample files":https://bitbucket.org/ShaolinAssassin/popstarter-documentation-stuff/downloads/hddosd_sample_files.7z. The .7z includes : 

- system.cnf = this file tells the PS2 where to look at for launching POPStarter (BOOT2 = pfs:/EXECUTE.KELF in system.cnf means that the file that will be launched from HDDOSD is EXECUTE.KELF, placed into the root of the partition). 

- list.ico = this file is a PS2 icon, made by myself using my profile picture from PSX-scene. You can learn how to create your own icons "here":http://web.archive.org/web/20140401012522/http://sksapps.com/index.php?page=Creating_Icons_tutorial.html (very easy). If you want that HDDOSD displays a special image when you are about to delete a game/partition, repeat the process and name this file del.ico.

- icon.sys = this files contains the infos that will be displayed in the HDDOSD. You need to edit it and fill some info inside. Use Notepad++.  

pre. 
PS2X
title0=Cotton Original // What will be displayed on the first line of the HDDOSD. Can be anything. I choose the name of the game. 16 caracters max.
title1=[SLPM-86461] // What will be displayed on the 2nd line of the HDDOSD. Can be anything. I choose the <game_ID> of the game. 16 caracters max.
bgcola=0 // Background's alpha value.
bgcol0=0,0,0 // Background's upper-left color (R,G,B).
bgcol1=0,0,0 // Upper-right.
bgcol2=0,0,0 // Lower-left.
bgcol3=0,0,0 // Lower-right.
lightdir0=1.0,-1.0,1.0 // Direction of light source 0 (X,Y,Z).
lightdir1=-1.0,1.0,-1.0 // Direction of light source 1 (X,Y,Z).
lightdir2=0.0,0.0,0.0 // Direction of light source 2 (X,Y,Z).
lightcolamb=64,64,64 // Ambient color (R,G,B).
lightcol0=64,64,64 // Color of light source 0 (R,G,B).
lightcol1=16,16,16 // Color of light source 1 (R,G,B).
lightcol2=0,0,0 // Color of light source 2 (R,G,B).
uninstallmes0= Voulez-vous supprimer ce jeu ? // Uninstall warning message. 
uninstallmes1= // Ignored if uninstallmes0 is 0 chars.
uninstallmes2= // Ignored if uninstallmes0/1 is 0 chars.

*7.* [PC] - So, create your icon(s) and edit icon.sys according to your will.

*8.* [PC] - Download AKuHAK’s reworked HDL_Dump zip folder, extract it at the root of your PC (C:), and delete boot.elf file from inside (it's miniopl - we don't need it).

*9.* [PC] - Drop your system.cnf, list.ico, icon.sys inside hdl_dumx folder. Hdl_dumx folder content : 

pre. 
- hdl_dumb.exe - no GUI version
- hdl_dump.exe - GUI version
- icon.sys 
- list.ico 
- system.cnf 

*10.* [PS2] - Connect your PS2 to your PC using a crossover cable, and launch hdl_svr_0.93.elf using uLE from it.

*11.* [PC] - Launch command promt.

*12.* [PC] - Type :

pre. 
cd C:\hdl_dumx_rev47\

*13.* [PC] - then : 

pre. 
C:\hdl_dumx_rev47\hdl_dump.exe modify_header 192.168.0.5 PP.Cotton_Original

192.168.0.5 = your PS2 IP adress ;
PP.Cotton_Original = your partition.

*14.* [PC] - if you got it working you should get a message like this : 

pre. 
Succesfully read system.cnf = system.cnf injected into partition header
Succesfully read icon.sys
Succesfully read list.ico
Skipped del.ico = del.ico file missing from hdl_dumx folder
Skipped boot.kelf
Skipped boot.elf
Skipped boot.kirx

*15.* Done ! ;)

*Note :* when POPStarter gets an update, delete the file EXECUTE.KELF from PP.Name_of_my_Game and replace it with the new version.
