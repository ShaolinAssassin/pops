h1. *Quick start guide for USB :*

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
_[UPDATE 2016/11/03 : new CUE2POPS version 2.3 included.]_


*


This is a *step-by-step basic guide* for new POPStarter users. If you are already familiar with POPStarter, you don't need it. 

Quickstarter pack includes *POPStarter last STABLE version [Rev 13 - WIP5]* - recommended version for new POPStarter users. Once you consider yourself comfortable enough with this version, you can upgrade to the last beta and enjoy/experiment the last features - or wait for the next stable version - it's up to you.

Quickstarter pack includes the *necessary files to setup POPStarter correctly, and nothing more*. Make sure your USB device is FAT12 or FAT16 or FAT32 formatted (not NTFS !) before proceding.

*STEPS :*

*0.* Download quickstarter pack and extract it on your desktop ; 

*1.* Create a folder named "POPS" (without "") in the root of your USB drive and copy/paste PFS_WRAP.BIN in it ;
 
*2.* Find and download "POPS.PAK" file (google it, I can't/won't give it to you) and copy it into POPS folder ;

*3.* POPStarter/POPS doesn't support PS1 games images as .iso - but only as .VCD. First convert your PS1 games to .bin/.cue (using "ImgBurn":http://imgburn.com/ for example). Then copy your .bin/.cue into CUE2POPS folder (from quickstarter pack), and run the file named BULK_CUE2POPS.BAT. You can convert several games at once using BULK_CUE2POPS.BAT.

*4.* Copy your .VCD into "POPS" folder on your USB device ;

*5.* Rename POPStarter.ELF to XX.Name of your game.ELF (example : XX.Crash Bandicoot.ELF). The name of your ELF and the name of your VCD must be the same - it's case sensitive.

Incorrect : 

pre. 
XX.CRASH BANDICOOT.ELF
Crash_Bandicoot.VCD

Correct : 

pre. 
XX.CRASH BANDICOOT.ELF
CRASH BANDICOOT.VCD


*6.* Your setup must look like this : 

pre. 
mass:/POPS/POPS.PAK
mass:/POPS/PFS_WRAP.BIN
mass:/POPS/Crash Bandicoot.VCD
mass:/XX.Crash Bandicoot.elf

*7.* Plug your USB device into your PS2, run XX.Name of your game.ELF with uLE and enjoy.
