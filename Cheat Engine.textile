h1. *Cheat Engine*


______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
_[Up-to-date with WIP 06, OBT 13 (2015/12/07)]_

h2. _Cheating :_

Since WIP06 OBT ?, POPStarter can use GameShark/Action Replay cheat codes writen into a text file. 

Create a text file nammed CHEATS.TXT, placed in the VMC folder of your game. In this text file, write $, then your code in GameShark/Action Replay format. 

pre. 
Ex : $800AC402 0800

Notes :

* Each game will have his own CHEATS.TXT file.
* Some PS1 games need mastercodes otherwise they crash (ex : Air Race Championship). Only type C0 are supported. Mastercodes of type C1 (aka activation on delay time) are not and will not be supported.
* You can enable a code for all your games if you place the CHEATS.TXT file in /POPS/ folder inteasted of the VMC folder.

h2. _Automated Codes:_ 

Some useful codes have been automatised. Here are them :

| *Cheat Code* | *Description* | *Notes* |
| $SAFEMODE | Disable the cheat engine and only activate it after POPS has left the PS OSD | Some game codes do patch the memory area where the PS OSD is loaded, causing crashes and other garbage... |
| $SMOOTH | Enables the smooth texture mapping at startup | |
| $NOPAL | Disables POPStarters' PAL patcher | |
| $FORCEPAL | Forces the activation of the PAL patcher (POPS will run it PAL) and patches the BIOS region code to Euro (shows the boot screen in PAL)  | Useful for PAL VCDs that don't have a valid license text in their bootsector | 
| $COMPATIBILITY_0x## | Activates a compatibility mode | (where ## is a hexadecimal value) You can write as many $COMPATIBILITY_0x## as you want |
| $CACHE1 | Makes POPS buffer 1 sector instead of 16 | |
| $FAKELC | Loads a null LibCrypt magic word into the cop0 register | May be needed by some discs that have a messed up LC protection |
| $USBDELAY_# | Sets up the PFS wrapper USB delay | (# is a number) |
