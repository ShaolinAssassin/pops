h2. _Cheating :_

Since WIP06 OBT 01, POPStarter can use GameShark/Action Replay cheat codes written into a text file. 

Create a text file named CHEATS.TXT & place it into the VMC folder of your game. In this text file, write $, then your code in GameShark/Action Replay format. 

Ex : 

pre. 
$800AC402 0800

*Notes :* 

* Each game must have his own CHEATS.TXT file.
* Some PS1 games need mastercodes otherwise they crash (ex : Air Race Championship). Only type C0 are supported. Mastercodes of type C1 (aka activation on delay time) are not and will not be supported.
* You can enable a code for all your games if you place the CHEATS.TXT file in POPS folder instead of the VMC folder.
