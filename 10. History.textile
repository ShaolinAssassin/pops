POPStarter Revision 13 - 2014/07/11, WIP 01 PUBLIC RELEASE
- Removed the PL-2301 launch method, same for the debugging thru NapClient.
- LC cracks for Ape Escape (SCES-02028), Ape Escape (SCES-01564) and Ape Escape (SCES-02031) were added.
- The POPS.PAK decompression bug that occured when debug printing was turned OFF has been fixed.
- Compiled with the NO_PFS_WRAPPER def, so it's OK to be distributed.
- The KELF wasn't tested. None of the betatesters (including me) use the HDDOSD crap anymore. The ELF was launched via uLE when testing in the PSX.
- The current project status is work in progress
