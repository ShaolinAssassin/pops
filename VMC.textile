h2. _Setting a path for the VMC folder

Here's how to change the destination VMC folder of your games :
Let's say your game is MY_GAME.VCD. The VMCs are saved to /POPS/MY_GAME/. You want the VMCs to be saved into /POPS/BLAHBLAH/ instead.
# Create an empty text file;
# Write BLAHBLAH into it;
# Save it as VMCDIR.TXT;
# Copy VMCDIR.TXT to /POPS/MY_GAME/

* *Notes :* 
*  All the POPStarter files (TROJANs, PATCHes, cheats...) will still be loaded from /POPS/MY_GAME/, but POPS will use the VMCs that are in /POPS/BLAHBLAH/
* Characters that are obviously not allowed are / \ and :
* VMCDIR.TXT will not be loaded if it's bigger than 103 bytes or if it contains more than 1 line.
* New folder must still be placed in POPS folder.
* Can not be used to swap disk for multi-disk games.
