h1. *POPStarter for USB*
______________________________________________________________________


h2. _POPS compressed file :_

To use POPStarter with an external HDD or a flash disk, you have to find and download the compressed POPS file. This file is named "POPS_IOP.PAK"... You are on your own to find it (google is your friend ;) )

| *File name* | *MD5* | *Description* | *Location* |
| POPS_IOX.PAK | a625d0b3036823cdbf04a3c0e1648901 | old POPS.PAK with network modules embedded | mass0:/POPS/ |

h2. _Other Software Requirements :_

* A software that allows you to convert your disc images to the POPS virtual CDROM format (such as ToolBox or CUE2POPS)
* A PS2 software that allows you to execute the POPStarter ELFs (such as uLaunchELF, or Free MC Boot...), or a GUI to execute POPSTARTER.ELF by selecting the VCDs (such as uLE_kHn_20150602)

h2. _Hardware Requirements :_

* A PS2 console which is able to run PS2 unsigned code
* An USB mass storage device, FAT12 or FAT16 or FAT32 formatted (not NTFS !)

h2. _A) Installing the Emulator :_

#  Find and download the emulator compressed file;
#  Create a directory named "POPS" in the root of your USB device;
# Copy POPS_IOP.PAK and PFS_WRAP.BIN into the "POPS" directory you've just created.

h2. _B) Installing your PS1 Games :_ 

# Convert your BIN/CUE disc images to .VCD files using the latest stable version of Toolbox;
# Put your .VCD files in the "POPS" directory which is in the root of your USB device.

h2. _C) Installing POPStarter :_ 

#  Rename the POPStarter ELF as the name of your VCDs, replace the .VCD extension with a .elf extension, add the XX. prefix;   [example : for running a VCD named "Gran Turismo.VCD", the POPStarter ELF must be renamed as "XX.Gran Turismo.elf"]
#  Copy or leave the ELFs where you want to run them from.
