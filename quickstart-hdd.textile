h1. *Quick start guide for internal HDD :*

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

This is a *step-by-step basic guide* for new POPStarter users. If you are already familiar with POPStarter, you don't need it. 

Quickstarter pack includes *last POPStarter STABLE version [Rev 13 - WIP5]* - recommended version for new POPStarter users. Once you consider yourself comfortable enough with this version, you can upgrade to the last beta and enjoy/experiment the last features - or wait for the next stable version - it's up to you.

Quickstarter pack includes the *necessary files to setup POPStarter correctly, and nothing more*. 

Quickstarter pack for USB : *"download": link *



*STEPS :*

*0.* Download quickstarter pack and extract it on your desktop ; 

*1.* Create a folder named "POPS" (without "") in the “__common” partition of your PS2 HDD ;
 
*2.* Find and download "POPS.ELF" and "IOPRP252.IMG" files (google them, I can't/won't give them to you) and paste them into POPS folder ;

*3.* POPStarter/POPS doesn't support PS1 games images as .iso - but only as .VCD. First convert your PS1 games to .bin/.cue (using "ImgBurn":http://imgburn.com/ for example). Then copy your .bin/.cue into CUE2POPS folder (from quickstarter pack), and run the file named BULK_CUE2POPS.BAT. You can convert several games at once using BULK_CUE2POPS.BAT.

*4.* Create a partition named  "__.POPS" in your PS2 HDD, large enough so you can put all your VCDs inside ;

*5.* Transfer your .VCDs into __.POPS partition. The recommended method is using RadHostClient. See "here": about how to use it. 

*5.* Rename POPStarter.ELF to Name of your game.ELF (example : Crash Bandicoot.elf) and copy/paste it into __.POPS partition.. The names of your ELF and the name of your VCD must be the same - it's case sensitive. 

Incorrect : 

pre. 
CRASH BANDICOOT.ELF
Crash_Bandicoot.VCD

Correct : 

pre. 
CRASH BANDICOOT.ELF
CRASH BANDICOOT.VCD


*6.* Your setup must look like this : 

pre. 
hdd:/__common/POPS/IOPRP252.IMG
hdd:/__common/POPS/POPS.ELF
hdd:/__.POPS/Crash Bandicoot.VCD
hdd:/__.POPS/Crash Bandicoot.elf

*7.* Run Name of your game.ELF with uLE and enjoy.
