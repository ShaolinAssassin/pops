* *Question : does POPS support mutitap player ?* 

*Answer :* Unfortunately, no. Only the 2 first controllers are recognised.


* *Question : does POPS support physical memory card saving ?*

*Answer :* No, it doesnt. There is a technical reason about it : POPS doesnt save on a single memory card block but flashes the whole VMC. Doing it on physical memory card would be very slow if possible.
