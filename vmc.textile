h2. _About VMC :_ 

When you launch a game for the very first time, a new folder named "GAME" (ex : Crash Bandicoot) will be created into your POPS directory (one separate directory for each game). It contains 2 files - SLOT0.VMC & SLOT1.VMC, which are your VMCs. 

If you know how to hexedit POPStarter, you can change that behavious to have only 1 VMC created - or not at all. Check the "configuration table":https://bitbucket.org/ShaolinAssassin/popstarter-documentation-stuff/wiki/configuration-table to know how to change the default setting (offset $429).

h2. _Setting a path for the VMC folder :_

Here's how to change the destination VMC folder of your games :
Let's say your game is MY_GAME.VCD. The VMCs are saved to /POPS/MY_GAME/. You want the VMCs to be saved into /POPS/BLAHBLAH/ instead.
# Create an empty text file;
# Write BLAHBLAH into it;
# Save it as VMCDIR.TXT;
# Copy VMCDIR.TXT to /POPS/MY_GAME/

Example :

pre. 
mass:/POPS/MY_GAME.VCD
mass:/POPS/MY_GAME/VMCDIR.TXT
mass:/POPS/BLAHBLAH/SLOT0.VMC
mass:/POPS/BLAHBLAH/SLOT1.VMC


*Notes :* 
*  All the POPStarter files (TROJANs, PATCHes, CHEATS.TXT...) will still be loaded from /POPS/MY_GAME/, but POPS will use the VMCs that are in /POPS/BLAHBLAH/
* Characters that are obviously not allowed are / \ and :
* VMCDIR.TXT will not be loaded if it's bigger than 103 bytes or if it contains more than 1 line.
* Target folder must remain in POPS folder.
* This feature is useful when you are several users and want to use different VMCs. Each user can have his own VMC folder.
* If you want to use a single pair of VMCs for ALL your games, place the VMCDIR.TXT file in POPS folder. The VMCs will not be overwritten but mounted and loaded, and you will be able to save in them with no data loss.

Example :

pre. 
smb:/YourSharedFolder/POPS/Crash Bandicoot.VCD
smb:/YourSharedFolder/POPS/Tekken.VCD
smb:/YourSharedFolder/POPS/Castlevania - Symphony of the night.VCD
smb:/YourSharedFolder/POPS/VMCDIR.TXT
smb:/YourSharedFolder/POPS/SAVES/SLOT0.VMC
smb:/YourSharedFolder/POPS/SAVES/SLOT1.VMC

with SAVES written into smb:/YourSharedFolder/POPS/VMCDIR.TXT

Here the 3 games mentionned will use smb:/YourSharedFolder/POPS/SAVES/SLOT0.VMC and smb:/YourSharedFolder/POPS/SAVES/SLOT1.VMC as VMCs with no issue.

h2. _Additional notes :_ 

* No physical MC support ATM - would be too slow.
